# abbyy8-frontend
The bachelor's ABBYY frontend course

Let's look at the pages.

1. The `main` page contains my photo, the information about me, and the projects I made
2. The `fun` page contains rotating torus
3. The first project has a link to a project page about frogs

The main idea of the project was to understand how to work with different libraries and frameworks rather than making the design.

## How to run?

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sevashasla/abbyy8-frontend.git
```
2. cd to the project folder & run the app folder
```bash
cd abbyy8-frontend/app && npm start
```
